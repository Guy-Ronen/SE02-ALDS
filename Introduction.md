# Introduction
At the backbone of every program there are two entities: data and algorithms. 
Algorithms transform data into something a program can effectively use. 

## Data Structures
Data structures are the way we are able to store and retrieve data.
The data structures that exist in programming languages are pretty similar to real-world systems that we use outside of the digital sphere.

### How are data structures used? 
* Inputting information
* Processing information
* Maintaining information
* Retrieving information

different data structures are better suited for different tasks. Choosing the wrong data structure can result in slow or unresponsive code (and mess up your program!), so itâ€™s important to consider a few factors as you make your decision:

1. What is the intended purpose for the data? Do any data structures have built-in functionality that is ideally suited for this purpose? Do you want to search, sort, or iterate data in a way in which certain data structures would be better suited than others?
2. Do you want or need control over how memory is set aside to store your data? Data structures that use static memory allocation (e.g., stacks or arrays) will manage memory for you and assume a fixed amount of memory upon instantiation with a cap on how much data may be added. Data structures that utilize dynamic memory allocation (e.g., heaps or linked lists) allow you to allocate and reallocate memory within the life of the program.
3. How long will it take different data structures to accomplish various tasks relative to other data structures? Technically, two data structures may both be able to accomplish the same task for you, but one may be quite a bit faster.

## Algorithms
Algorithms are instructions that the computer follows to carry out tasks. There are many, many types of algorithms, but some common ones are:
* Sorting algorithms
* Search algorithms
* Divide and conquer algorithms
* Greedy algorithms
* Brute force algorithms

### How are algorithms used?
Algorithms are used to manipulate and process data. Data structures are useful in maintaining and storing data, but algorithms are what actually utilize that data.
