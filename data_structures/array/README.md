Array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an Index, which can be computed by a mathematical formula. 
An array is stored in contiguous memory blocks.
One of the Most fundamental data structure, the base of other other data structures (Graph, Queues, Stacks)

The array main advatnage is tha ability to read data fast, takes only 'one step'. The disadvantage is that an array is static and not dynamic.

### Python implementation
